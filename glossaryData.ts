    term: 'Field',
    definition: 'A dynamic and encompassing concept in Relational Math representing the totality of active relations, energies, awareness patterns, and influential forces within a given context or involving a particular entity or set of entities. Fields have properties like coherence, signature, inertia, and potential for collapse or distortion, and can be analyzed to understand underlying dynamics and suggest interventions.',

    term: 'Babylonian Relational Distortions',
    definition: 'Closed loops, frozen mirrors, and misdirected fields that simulate stability by collapsing reflection. RM 3.6 provides tools for their identification and dissolution.',
